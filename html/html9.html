<h1><a id="a">COMPUTER</a></h1>
<h4><u><a href="#top">GO TO TOP</a></u></h4>
<p>
	A computer is a programmable machine that is both electronic and digital. The actual machinery is hardware; the instructions and data is software
</p>
<h3><a id="b">CPU</a></h3>
<p>
	A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor or main processor, is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at least since the early 1960s.[1] Traditionally, the term "CPU" refers to a processor, more specifically to its processing unit and control unit (CU), distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry
</p>
<h3><a id="c">ALU</a></h3>
<p>
	Image result for alu
    arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs
</p>
<h1><a id="d">PROGRAMMIN LANGUAGES</a></h1>
<p>
	A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal.
</p>
<h3><a id="e">C</a></h3>
<p>
	C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations
</p>
<h3><a id="f">C++</a></h3>
<p>
	C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes
</p>
<h3><a id="g">Java</a></h3>
<p>
	Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible
</p>
<h3><a id="h">Python</a></h3>
<p>
	Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace
</p>
<h3><a id="i">JavaScript</a></h3>
<p>
	JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions
</p>
<h1><a id="j">DBMS</a></h1>
<p>
	A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database
</p>
<h3><a id="k">RDBMS</a></h3>
<P>
	A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and others to create, update, administer and otherwise interact with a relational database
</P>
<h3><a id="l">OODBMS</a></h3>
<p>
	OODBMS stands for Object-Oriented Database Management System. An object-oriented database management system (also known simply as an object database ) is a DBMS where data is represented in the form of objects, as used in object-oriented programming.
</p>
<h3><a id="m">HDBMS</a></h3>
<P>
	A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. ... A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row in the relational database model and an entity type corresponds to a table.
</P>
<h3><a id="n">ORDBMS</a></h3>
<p>
	ORDBMS stands for Object-Relational Database Management System. An ORDBMS is a database management system that is a hybrid between the object-oriented model (OODBMS) and the relational model (RDBMS
